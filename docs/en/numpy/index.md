This book is about arrays. The Deep Learning row runs CPython 3.14 plus NumPy inside Pyodide. That interpreter is separate from the WASI Python row. Run executes only the snippet in front of you.

### Make one array

np.array takes a plain list and returns an ndarray. The first entry of shape is the length, and sum adds the values.

```numpy run expect="3 16" title="Three numbers"
import numpy as np
# Length and total
a = np.array([2, 5, 9])
print(a.shape[0], int(a.sum()))
```

The terminal prints 3 16.

### Stdin still works

input waits until the host writes a line into shared memory. This snippet reads an integer and multiplies by four. The fence supplies the line 3.

```numpy run expect="12" title="Times four" stdin="3\n"
n = int(input())
# Read a multiplier
print(n * 4)
```

The printed product is 12.

### Separate from the other Python

The WASI CPython build does not ship NumPy, so that import fails there. Keep array examples on this row. The teaching package minitorch is preinstalled only in this filesystem.
