# Third-party licenses

SimpleCode vendors language runtimes into `wasm/` (not committed; see `./build.sh vendor`). The notices below cover those runtimes and the toolchains used to build Lua, Go, and Shell. License texts are the upstream notices; they are included so a deployment can ship them with the binaries.

## Application

- [Runno](https://github.com/taybenlor/runno) `@runno/wasi` — MIT. Provides the in-browser WASI preview1 host.
- UI dependencies (Vue, Monaco, xterm, Tailwind, shadcn-vue / reka-ui) — see each package's license in `node_modules`.
- [Sucrase](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase) — MIT. Loaded in the browser only when TypeScript is run, to strip types before QuickJS. It does not type-check.

## Runtimes copied from Runno `langs/`

| Runtime | License |
|---|---|
| CPython 3.11.3 (VMware WebAssembly Language Runtimes) | PSF License |
| Ruby 3.2.0 | Ruby License / BSD-2-Clause |
| PHP 8.2.0 cgi | PHP License 3.01 |
| wasmedge-quickjs | Apache-2.0 (QuickJS itself is MIT) |
| SQLite 3 | Public Domain |
| clang / wasm-ld (binji wasm-clang, LLVM 8) | Apache-2.0 with LLVM exceptions |

## Lua 5.4.9

Built from https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.4.9.tar.gz with wasi-sdk 33. Lua is MIT:

```

wasi-sdk / LLVM is Apache-2.0 with LLVM exceptions. wasi-libc is a mix of MIT, BSD, and Apache-2.0 (see the wasi-sdk sysroot). The Wasm binary links `libc`, `libsetjmp`, `libwasi-emulated-signal`, and `libwasi-emulated-process-clocks` from that sysroot.

## Go (Yaegi 0.16.1 on Go 1.22.12)

- [Yaegi](https://github.com/traefik/yaegi) v0.16.1 — Apache-2.0. Copyright Traefik Labs and contributors.
- The wasm binary also contains the Go 1.22.12 runtime and standard library, which are BSD-3-Clause:

Source for the small WASI wrapper is `scripts/builders/go/main.go` in this repository.

## Shell (wasi-sh)

`wasi-sh.wasm` is compiled from `scripts/builders/shell/wasi-sh.c` in this repository with wasi-sdk 33. It is a small single-process shell (builtins and in-memory pipes only). It is not GNU bash and not BusyBox.

The shell source is MIT:

```

The binary links wasi-libc from wasi-sdk (MIT, BSD, and Apache-2.0; see the wasi-sdk sysroot). Public bash and BusyBox wasm builds were not vendored: they need host imports this runtime does not provide, and their licenses are GPL (see plan/LANGUAGES.md §9.1).

## Rust (weblings)

Not part of the default `./build.sh vendor`. `./build.sh vendor --rust` checks the pinned `artifacts-test-7` archives from [AngelOnFira/wasm-rustc](https://github.com/AngelOnFira/wasm-rustc/releases/tag/artifacts-test-7) and writes `wasm/rust/rustc.wasm` plus `wasm/rust/sysroot-wasip1.bundle`. The page may also fetch those two unpacked files from the weblings demo. Digests are in `scripts/sources.lock.json`.

- [weblings](https://github.com/AngelOnFira/weblings) — MIT. The compiler worker in `src/rustc/worker.js` follows its `app/public/worker.js`.
- rustc and Cranelift (`rustc_codegen_cranelift`) — MIT OR Apache-2.0. The wasm binary is the pinned artifact above.
- [browser_wasi_shim](https://github.com/bjorn3/browser_wasi_shim) — Apache-2.0 OR MIT. The copies under `src/rustc/shim/` come from the weblings `app/public/vendor/browser_wasi_shim` tree and are used only to host rustc, not the user's program.
- [fzstd](https://github.com/101arrowz/fzstd) — MIT. Used by `scripts/vendor-rust.mjs` to decompress the archives. It is not loaded in the browser.

## Java (TeaVM)

Not part of the default `./build.sh vendor`. `./build.sh vendor --java` downloads four files from `https://teavm.org/playground/3/` into `wasm/java/`. Digests are in `scripts/sources.lock.json`. The page loads those same-origin copies only. `teavm.org` does not send CORS headers, so a COEP page cannot fetch the upstream URLs.

- [TeaVM](https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm) 0.16.0 — Apache-2.0. Copyright Alexey Andreev and contributors. `compiler.wasm-runtime.js` is the playground runtime and carries that Apache-2.0 header.
- [teavm-javac](https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm-javac) — the README states Apache-2.0. The GitHub license field for that repository is empty.
- `compiler.wasm` contains OpenJDK `javac`. That compiler is GPL-2.0 with the Classpath Exception.
- The TeaVM class library includes portions of Apache Harmony (Apache-2.0), Joda-Time (Apache-2.0), and jzlib (BSD-style).
- `src/teavm/bridge/` is source written for this repository: a replacement `TConsoleInputStream`, a small `TScanner`, and a `TInputStreamReader` that does not touch `java.nio`. The `Scanner` stub appended to the SDK archive in memory is the same small class, compiled with `--patch-module java.base`. `org.teavm.interop.Import` is used only when rebuilding that bridge with a host `javac`. It is not a separate download.

## LeetCode solutions

Problem numbers in `docs/leetcode/` come from public lists. Statements are not copied. Solution source files are copied from four repositories pinned in `docs/leetcode/sources.lock.json` (retrieved 2026-10-18). Each file records the upstream URL, commit, and modifications. The same-origin license texts are `docs/leetcode/LICENSES/MIT.txt` and `docs/leetcode/LICENSES/CC-BY-SA-4.0.txt`.

## Linux guest (v86 + Buildroot image)

The sidebar language Linux is not a WASI module. `./build.sh vendor` downloads pinned files and writes `wasm/linux-state.zst`, a zstd frame of the v86 snapshot. The browser stores that frame in the Cache API and hands it to v86, which decompresses it with the zstd already linked into `v86.wasm`. The `zstd` CLI used at vendor time is build-only (BSD-3-Clause or GPL-2.0, https://github.com/facebook/zstd); it is not shipped to the page.

- [v86](https://github.com/copy/v86) 0.5.471 (`libv86.mjs`, `v86.wasm`) — BSD-2-Clause. Copyright (c) 2012, The v86 contributors. The full notice is `LICENSES/v86-BSD-2-Clause.txt`. The npm package also bundles Berkeley SoftFloat and other pieces listed in the upstream README; those stay inside the vendored `libv86` build.
- SeaBIOS and the VGA BIOS (`seabios.bin`, `vgabios.bin`) come from the v86 `bios/` directory. SeaBIOS is LGPL-2.1 (`COPYING.LESSER` in the SeaBIOS sources). The files are pinned by sha256 because the npm tarball does not include them.
- Guest kernel: Linux **6.8.12** i686, GPL-2.0. The bzImage is the unmodified v86 demo file `https://i.copy.sh/buildroot-bzimage68.bin` (profile “Buildroot Linux 6.8”), not a Buildroot 2026.08 tree built in this repository.
- Guest userspace: Buildroot **2024.05.2** (`/etc/os-release`) and BusyBox **1.36.1** (GPL-2.0). BusyBox source for that version: https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.36.1.tar.bz2 . Buildroot 2024.05.2: https://buildroot.org/downloads/buildroot-2024.05.2.tar.gz . The image is prebuilt; `scripts/builders/linux/rebuild.sh` documents a Linux or Docker fetch of Buildroot 2026.08 and is not what `./build.sh vendor` runs. A from-scratch image would not match the pinned digest.
- 9p on this image is mounted at `/mnt` (tag `host9p`), not `/mnt/host`.
